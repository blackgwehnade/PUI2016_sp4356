In the first part of HW8 I merge 311 complaint data with demographics and telecommunication services records for each community district of NYC. To facilitate that I clean the data (fix wrong entries and remove missing/duplicate values). Up to this point I collaborated with Felipe Gonzalez (_fdg224_). Then I identify variables of interest from demographics and telecommunication services data, harmonize the variable related to community district ID (using regular expressions) and finally merge the three datasets. Plot total complaints against other variables of interest to examine whether there is a relation with the number of 311 complaints in a district. 

In the second part I review the plots from HW7 for two of my classmates, namely _xh895_ and _ys2808_.
